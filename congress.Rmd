```{r}
data("congress_age")

congress_age %>% 
  mutate(year = format(termstart, "%Y")) %>%
  filter(party %in% c("D", "R")) %>%
  group_by(year, party)%>%
  summarise(average_age = mean(age)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = average_age, group = party, color = party)) + geom_line() + labs(title = "Average Congressional Age By Year", subtitle = "At start of term, 1947-2013", source = "538 R Package") 
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
